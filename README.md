STATUS: Working, but not generalized (for personal use right now)

Extract parts of your shell dotfiles into a separate file. For example, given the files

```sh

alias kssh='kitty +kitten ssh'
alias l='exa -al --icons --git' # clone(user, root)

# clone(user, root)
mkcd() {
	command mkdir -p -- "$@"
	cd -- "$@" || { _shell_util_die "mkcd: could not cd"; return; }
}
```

The annotated aliases and functions will be extracted

```sh
# shellcheck shell=bash
# Autogenerated from dotshellextract in https://github.com/hyperupcall/dotshellextract

# Autogenerated. Do NOT edit!
alias kssh='kitty +kitten ssh'

# Autogenerated. Do NOT edit!
mkcd() {
	command mkdir -p -- "$@"
	cd -- "$@" || { _shell_util_die "mkcd: could not cd"; return; }
}
```

This is useful if you want to have a subset of your shell configuration available for remote servers or for usage as superuser (but do not want to copy and paste configuration files everywhere)



## Installation

Use [Basalt](https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt), a Bash package manager, to install this project globally

```sh
basalt global add hyperupcall/dotshellgen
```

Additionally, a version of Perl is required

## Usage

I do _not_ recommend using this utility right now. Everything is hardcoded for personal use (this was extracted from my dotfiles repository)

```sh
dotshellgen
```
